            <big><p>
                Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, 
                but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:
                Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. 
                Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. 
                Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.
                Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. 
                Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <big><ul>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
                </ul></big>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
                <big><ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. 
                        Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands 
                        or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, 
                        or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                        should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
